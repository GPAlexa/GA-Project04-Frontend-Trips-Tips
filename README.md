# Project Overview
TripTips is a MERN-Stack community application which guides User into finding their next travel experience. As a visitor the functionality is limited to viewing the Top 10 most-liked trips and browsing the existing ones, but as a registered User you can add your own travel experiences and like existing ones which will, subsequently, be stored in your "favs" page, making it easy and convenient to find them again. This is a built-from-scratch full stack project which was developed and delivered over two weeks by a group of three junior devs.

# Goal
A working full-stack, single-page application hosted on Heroku that incorporates the technologies of the MERN-stack. The app should have a well-styled interactive front-end, should communicate with the Express back-end via AJAX, implement a token-based authentication (including the ability of a User to sign-up, log-in and log-out) and authorization by restricting the functionality to authenticated Users. The navigation also responds to the login status. Full-CRUD data operations to be implemented as well.
